  {
    "input": "I feel like I'm never good enough at work. No matter how hard I try, I always feel like I'm failing.",
    "output": "That sounds really difficult. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel that way?"
  },
  {
    "input": "I always compare myself to my colleagues, and they seem to be doing better than me.",
    "output": "So, you believe your colleagues are doing better. What evidence do you have to support that belief?"
  },
  {
    "input": "Well, they get praised more often in meetings.",
    "output": "That\u2019s one observation. But are there times when you have also been recognized for your work?"
  },
  {
    "input": "I guess my manager did say I did a good job on a recent project.",
    "output": "So there is evidence that you are doing well too. How does that change your perspective on your performance at work?"
  },
  {
    "input": "I feel like nobody likes me, and I\u2019ll always be alone.",
    "output": "That sounds really painful. What makes you think nobody likes you?"
  },
  {
    "input": "People don\u2019t invite me to things, and I feel left out.",
    "output": "I see. Is it possible that people might have other reasons for not inviting you, aside from not liking you?"
  },
  {
    "input": "I guess they could just be busy or assume I wouldn\u2019t want to come.",
    "output": "That\u2019s an interesting perspective. Have there been times when people have reached out to you?"
  },
  {
    "input": "Well, my friend did text me last week to check in.",
    "output": "So, you do have people who care about you. How might you change your thoughts around being alone?"
  },
  {
    "input": "I can\u2019t handle stressful situations; I always shut down.",
    "output": "What do you mean by \u2018shut down\u2019? Can you give me an example?"
  },
  {
    "input": "If I have a big project due, I procrastinate and avoid it until the last minute.",
    "output": "I see. And what do you tell yourself when you procrastinate?"
  },
  {
    "input": "I think that I won\u2019t be able to do it well enough, so I avoid it.",
    "output": "That makes sense. Have there been times when you faced a challenge and managed to complete it successfully?"
  },
  {
    "input": "Actually, yes. I usually do well when I finally start.",
    "output": "So, despite your doubts, you have a pattern of succeeding. How might this realization help you approach stress differently?"
  },
  {
    "input": "I\u2019m terrified of making mistakes. If I mess up, it means I\u2019m a failure.",
    "output": "That\u2019s a strong belief. What makes you think that making a mistake means you\u2019re a failure?"
  },
  {
    "input": "People will judge me and think I\u2019m not good at what I do.",
    "output": "Has there been a time when you made a mistake and still received support or understanding?"
  },
  {
    "input": "Yes, once I made a mistake at work, and my boss helped me fix it instead of getting angry.",
    "output": "That\u2019s interesting. How does that challenge the belief that mistakes define your worth?"
  },
  {
    "input": "I guess it shows that mistakes don\u2019t always mean failure. They can be a chance to learn.",
    "output": "Exactly. How might you use this perspective to be kinder to yourself when you make mistakes in the future?"
  },
  {
    "input": "I get really anxious in crowded places and just want to leave.",
    "output": "That must be challenging. What do you think makes crowded places so overwhelming for you?"
  },
  {
    "input": "I feel like I can\u2019t control what\u2019s happening, and something bad could happen at any moment.",
    "output": "That\u2019s a strong fear. Has anything dangerous ever happened to you in a crowd before?"
  },
  {
    "input": "No, not really, but I just feel like it could.",
    "output": "So, your fear is based on what might happen rather than what has happened. Have you ever managed to stay in a crowd and feel okay afterward?"
  },
  {
    "input": "Yes, once I stayed at a concert and actually ended up enjoying it.",
    "output": "That\u2019s a great example. How might you remind yourself of that experience the next time you feel anxious in a crowd?"
  }
